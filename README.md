## Experience uniquely deterministic visualizations

Dreaming is what you make of it. Whatever you type in is what generates the experience, including the time that you submit the form. We encourage you to be as descriptive as possible. Experiences will be automatically saved to be viewed again at a later time if you so wish.

> You can save an experience before submitting the input, or while you watch.

## Recall your dreams

Dreams, like memories, cannot be recalled with perfect recollection. Every time you try to remember an event happening, it changes slightly and loses less detail.

In our **Dream Engine** application, visualizations can be replayed to the exact specification, so long as you choose it from our _Memory Bank_.

> We timestamp all entries, and timestamps are part of the deterministic calculations for the dreaming experience. You cannot re-enter the same input, e.g., "I dreamt about ponies" and receive the same experience twice. They may be _similar_, but not exact!

## Share your dreams

Ever talk to a friend about a cool or weird dream you had? Well now you can share our generated visualizations with them!
